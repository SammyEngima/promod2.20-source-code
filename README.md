This version have some modern features:
- It's 2019, 333 fps have to be allowed, and it is in this version (edit [this](https://github.com/gogo1207/promod2.20-source-code/blob/7d78667217116af8ed20860a92fded0ded6ef8ef/ui_mp/hud.menu#L998), change 333 to 250 to rollback to 250 max)
- Added music and sound tables so you can add custom music later to the .iwd and .gsc without recompileing .ff again and again
